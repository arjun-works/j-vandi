## File Structure

- `app.py` - Main Streamlit application
- `database.py` - SQLite database management
- `cab_logic.py` - Cab allocation algorithms
- `populate_db.py` - Database initialization script
- `cab_nodal_points_lat_&_long_08.07.25.csv` - Base location data
- `sample_poc_data.xlsx` - Sample POC data for testing

## Database

The application uses SQLite database (`cab_nodal_points.db`) to store:
- Base location data (Area_Id, Area, Latitude, Longitude)
- Persistent storage accessible from anywhere

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
python test_app.py
```

## Notes

- The application maintains the original cab allocation logic
- UI for cab allocation and mapping remains unchanged for the core functionality
- Admin can only upload base data - no other options available
- POC has full access to cab allocation and management features
- All changes are saved and can be downloaded as Excel files
